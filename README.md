# README-Generator

In this project, we created a README.md Generator. 
Using inline command a user is prompted questions.
The user than inputs their answers and a writetoFile function is initalized.
Through generate markdown we made the README capable of formating with specific headings, 
a Table of Contents, Links to our Contact Info and link to the the license we are using via a badge.
